    <h2>Personal information</h2>
    <img src="me.jpg" width="20%" alt="me">

    <p>&nbspHello world and hello everyone! My name is Taehyeon Jeong (s3799019) and I am from a maritime city in the southeast part of Korea called Ulsan. The city is famous for sunrise but if you want to travel in Korea, I don't want to recommend Ulsan for tourist. I am currently living as a pescatarian, so I eat everything but meat. And I can speak 3 languages which are Korean, English, and tiny bit of Vietnamese. I am learning Vietnamese. Welcome to initiate a conversation in these three languages!</p>
    <p>&nbspRunning is my favorite activity. It always refreshes me when I am stuck in problems and worries. In my free time, I enjoy trekking and indoor climbing as well. I want to experience more in Vietnam if I have a chance. I am also inclined towards creative activities such as photography and music. I learned Korean traditional instruments and used to play the piano and guitar. I enjoy playing these as a hobby. I also used to take pictures so check out my photography album if you want! -> <a href = "http://juta.creatorlink.net/INTRO"> http://juta.creatorlink.net/ </a>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>&nbspToday we live in an era of excessive information. Higher accessibility from handy devices as if smartphone and lab tap let people obtain various information. But information gap is still existed. Older people and people with disable are having trouble for using digital devices. For example, self-service kiosk often unclear and not friendly for older people and people with disable. Therefore, the majority of them need help from others or rather do not use. Being unable to use digital technology might lead information gap and opportunity gap further economical gap. It affects not only inconvenience in daily life but also worsen the quality of life.  I want to help them by developing programs to bridge the gap. To do that, I thought understanding and having knowledge is critical and should be first. As a result, my interest was headed to the Information technology. Through this course, I want to take overall understanding in IT and hope it helps to choose the specific direction.</p>

    <p>&nbspMy biggest interest in IT is AI technology. Amongst the AI field, deep learning using big data technology is the most interesting part for me. Deep learning technology that computers train themselves without human effort to find and classify patterns in objects or pictures can be used in almost every field includes bio, medical, finance, communication. Big enterprises such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google imply in the real services by utilize big data. And one day I want to develop sign language translation program that recognizes and interprets sign language motion without the real person, and program and product that recognize the objects and let blind people by sound instead of their sight by using this technology.</p>
    <p>&nbspThe reason why I choose to come to RMIT is because I thought studying at RMIT is an opportunity to enhance my competitiveness. RMIT provides students a lot of experience associated with real IT fields so that students are offered practical assistance when they work in the future. Also, I think it is possible to expand my language because I can learn and use English and Vietnamese while studying in RMIT Vietnam. I think Learning new languages and living in an unfamiliar place allows us to think in different way and it influences our view towards the world.</p>

    <br>

    <p>&nbsp This job position appeals to me because the overall skills in IT as if network, security, application development, active directory are applied to the job. IT skills would be developed and expended through the Information Technology specialist position. Also, the biopharmaceutical company, Celltrion Healthcare has high potential for development in this era. Therefore, self-development and advancement about IT are attainable. But looking at the responsibilities of this position, the task of this position is not only the overall skills in IT but also to develop strategies, analyze for efficient performance, and design solutions for business. It is an expert position for the person who already have considerable experience in IT field rather than actual projects or applications developer. Therefore, critical abilities for the job are business analysis and establishing IT strategy, and communication such as negotiation, relationship and project management, presentation, and collaboration skills. Interpersonal skill to work with many architects and business is also indispensable.</p>
    <p>&nbspUnfortunately, I am not adequate to apply for the IT specialist position right now. I do not have any practical experiences and career in IT field or any IT certifications. It is required at least 5 years IT experience and professional business skills. Thus, I should build my IT experience through the work in practical business at first. I will establish the overall Information technology knowledge and experiences the real work industry applying an internship during the university years, and I will take communication classes in business and management major on elective courses.</p>
    <p>&nbspAnd the applicants who have certification as if ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), PMP (Project Management Professional), CISA (Certified Information System Auditor) are preferred for the job. ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library and it is de-facto standards of IT service management. Firstly, I will apply for the ITIL Foundation certification test which is not required any qualification for examination during the school years. Qualification of examination of PMP and CISA for bachelor graduate, more than 3 years of PM (project management) and 5 years of IS (Information System) hands on experience, respectively. In addition, 35 hours of PM education and pass the CISA exam are prerequisite to get the certifications. Therefore, I will learn more about the certification detail and get it after hands on work experience.</p>
    <p>&nbspCelltrion is a multinational company. Most businesses are conducted overseas includes U.S., Europe. 30% of employees are international and most communication are conducted in English, speaking and writing for business is critical. I felt my English is inadequate for the job. I will use my time to intensify the English studies to improve business English skills progressively with getting certification. </p>

      <br>
      <p>&nbspMediator type of persons do not try to achieve many things at once and paying attention to only one goal. For me it is kind of true because when I do something, I can only concentrate on one task. I cannot simultaneously do many tasks at once. So, I will only focus on the group project after team project is started. And as a person of mediator type, I am able to coordinate each other's positions well within the team when the arguments or conflict occurs.</p>

      <h3>- Learning style</h3>
      <img src="learning style.png" alt="Learning Style" width="80%">
      <br>
      <p>&nbspI learn better through visual and tactile learning than by auditory learning. The result saying “you may be easily distracted by sounds” is really accurate. I cannot easily concentrate on my work in noisy places so that my favorite work/study place is library or quite café. However, since learning cannot be executed in just one style, I want to study with contrasting team members with different learning styles and experience and develop different styles of learning.</p>

      <h3>- Big Five Personality</h3>
      <img src="big five personality.png" alt="Big 5 Personality" width="100%">
      <p>The big 5 personality result showed that the highest score is in openness, I agree that I tend to be inquisitive and open to the new things. This personality would help to conceive creative and adventurous ideas in the project. On the other hand, Conscientiousness was the lowest as a 33%. I should put my effort to reinforce the self-discipline. I will try to make up the deficiencies in these five characteristics and hope I can help the team project.</p>

      <h2>Project ideas</h2>
      <h4>- Overview:</h4> <p>This project is to create a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser by using Arduino. The beginning of the idea was started from hand sanitizer in RMIT. Since coronavirus survive on the surface of objects for a long time, hand sanitizers that many people use are also likely to be contaminated. Therefore, I wanted to make a machine that could be used without physical touch. To explain about the machine in brief, the ultrasonic sensor and two motors are connected to each other and the ultrasonic sensor detects the hand and the motors are operated. The string or wire connected to the motor and it presses the push-nozzle press and the sanitizer come out. I hope this project proceed successful and be used in practice.</p>

      <h4>- Motivation:</h4>
      <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has radically changed the world. It changed our daily life and brings social, economic, and environment change. As everyone knows, we should be cautious the close human-to-human contact and be careful when touching public objects such as handles or elevator buttons to avoid infection. Also, we should manage our personal hygiene such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. Using sanitizer is also recommended. Hand sanitizers are placed in every elevator, floor and building in RMIT. But when we use the sanitizer, we should push the button of hand sanitizer dispenser. Physical touch is unavoidable and therefore there is a possibility of transmission. Automatic hand sanitizer dispensers are selling at the shop, but it is expensive and not that affordable. Therefore, using Arduino is economical and practical solution for this problem.</p>

      <h4>- Description:</h4>
      <p>When I first came up with the idea of a contactless automatic hand sanitizer dispenser, the most important and considerable thing was that operating the machine without touching. Therefore, I thought I should use a sensor that can detect a person's hand without touching the push-type hand sanitizer push nozzle. The hand sanitizer dispenser should be pumped the hand sanitizer after detecting the approach of the hand when the hand was placed close to the dispenser. Accordingly, the temperature sensor or ultrasonic sensor were considered as a tool to detect the distance of objects or person. However, temperature sensors are less accurate and not suitable to distinguish human hands if it is used in outdoors because the temperature in Ho Chi Minh City is similar to human body temperature. For the reason, I will use an ultrasonic sensor that calculates the distance of an object when hands approach within a certain distance. The ultrasonic sensor will be placed directly below the nozzle press pump of the dispenser so that people can use it with only one hand. If people put their hand close to the sensor, sanitizer will be pumped even if they don't move your hand to other parts of sanitizer dispenser. If the position of the ultrasonic sensor is different, both hands or moving towards nozzle pump are needed.
      </p>

      <p>In the case of pumping, the initial plan was that operating it using different pump, but it is not that hygienic than just pressing it by using hand. Therefore, I decided to use the method that physically pressing the push nozzle instead of the hand. To do that, two motors will be used. And these two motors will perform and repeat the pressing action. The hand sanitizer is put to the middle, one motor is placed on the left side and one on the right side and two motors fix on the floor. And then, the push-nozzle part of the hand sanitizer connects with two motors respectively by a single string or wire and fix the straps or wire with a glue gun or Velcro to do not move back and forth. The two motors can simultaneously press the push nozzle with equal power, giving the same pressure as if it is pressed by a hand. </p>
      <p>The quantity of sanitizer will be adjusted by the time how long you put your hand to the sensor. For example, if you put your hand to the sensor without a break, pumping also be continued until you pull your hand from the dispenser.</p>
      <img src="sanitizer front.png" width="50%" alt="sanitizer front" align = left>
      <img src= "sanitizer side.png" width="50%" alt="sanitizer side" align = right>
      <p>The above pictures are just simple example and only explain the fundamental principle. If it is actually made, it will assemble like a machine that structure of attaching motor and ultrasonic sensor to an acrylic plate, or plastic box. If you put the motor and sensor in the box and adjust the length of the string connected to the motor, you can put all push type of bottles into the contactless dispenser machine and combine it to operate it immediately.</p>

      <h4>- Tools and technologies: </h4>
      <li>Push type of hand sanitizer</li>
      <li>Arduino board</li>
      <li>Computer</li>
      <li>Ultrasonic sensor</li>
      <li>Two motors</li>
      <li>Wire or String</li>
      <li>Cables</li>
      <li>Acrylic plate or plastic box</li>
      <li>Adhesive or glue gun</li>
      <li>Velcro (optional)</li>
      <p>First, the controller board, Arduino and computer to write codes is fundamental to generate the machine. Besides that, Ultrasonic sensor which detects the approach of people and two motors to pull the wire or string are needed. Arduino will be connected to the ultrasonic sensor and two motors by the wire. And an adhesive, glue gun, or Velcro is required to keep the wire or string and do not fall from the push-nozzle press. Acrylic plates or plastic boxes will be used to make the components above into a single machine, and if it's necessary, cut them and attach them to the plate or box with glue guns or glue. Finally, a push-type hand sanitizer that is combined with the machine is needed.</p>

      <h4>- Skills Required:</h4>
      <p>To make and operate machines using Arduino an overall understanding about Arduino is needed. First, an understanding of various components of the Arduino board is needed, and the method and ability of connecting components such as sensors, motors, and wires to the Arduino body are needed. Also, I must program Arduino so that it can function as I want. I must learn the new language and compile to put programs in Arduino because Arduino's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is based on C, C++, and Java. Python is the only language I can write right now, so it will take a lot of time and difficulties to learn.</p>

      <h4>- Outcome:</h4>
      <p>If the components and supplies are accurately connected and codes are properly written, automatic hand sanitizer dispenser will successfully operate. It will attach to the original push type dispensers and everyone who work and study in RMIT will use automatic sanitizer dispenser without the concern of contact. It can also be utilized for hand soap dispenser that use in other public places. Contact is not needed when people use the push type of dispenser of this project, so personal hygiene problem will be improved. Maintaining good hygiene help prevent Covid-19. Therefore, it might help to reduce infection and the probability of transmission can be decline.</p>
